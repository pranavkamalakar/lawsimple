## What it does (short)
LawSimple converts legal text into a simple, plain-language summary and highlights important clauses (e.g., penalties, obligations). Each clause is tagged with a **risk level** (High / Medium / Low / Info) so users can quickly spot red flags. Users can also generate and download a full **Analysis Report** that includes the summary, key highlights, and clause-by-clause breakdown with tags.  

The goal is to make contracts and legal documents accessible to non-experts (students, startups, individuals).
