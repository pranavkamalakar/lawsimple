## What it does (short)
LawSimple converts legal text into a simple, plain-language summary and highlights important clauses (e.g., penalties, obligations). The goal is to make contracts and legal documents accessible to non-experts (students, startups, individuals).

## Current features (prototype)
- Paste legal text → get a plain-language summary (English)
- Deployed on a Lovable domain for live demo

---

## Planned (for final demo)
- Multilingual summaries (English, Hindi, Marathi)  
- OCR for images/scanned PDFs (Tesseract.js / cloud fallback)  
- Full PDF upload & parsing  
- Clause extraction & red-flag tagging  
- Download summary (TXT/PDF)

## Quick judge testing steps

2. Paste this sample text:
   > “The lessee shall maintain insurance and pay all taxes. Failure to comply will result in a penalty of 5% monthly.”
3. Click **Summarize** → expect a plain-language summary in ~5–15s.  
4. Check for highlighted clause(s) and risk tags.  
5. (Optional) Download the summary if the button is available.
